# ToKnow
- **Data6.packet** Data from a full day, it was analyzed and no ilicit behaviour was found. Each device has a static IPV4
- **test6.packet** Data from a full day where there might contain ilicit behaviour like a **botnet** (A botnet is a group of Internet-connected devices, each of which runs one or more bots. Botnets can be used to perform Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks, steal data, send spam, and allow the attacker to access the device and its connection), **data exfiltration** and remote **C&C of devices** (Command and controll)
- **Servers6.paquet** data from a fully day of external access to corp servers(200.0.0.0/24)

# TODO
Tasks:
- Analysis of the non-anomalous behaviors; identify internal server/services, describe and quantify
traffic exchanges from internal users with internal and external servers, and describe and quantify
traffic exchanges from external users with the corporation public servers (4 points).
- Definition of the SIEM rules and respective justification for detection of internal BotNet activities,
data exfiltration using HTTPS and or DNS, C&C activities using DNS, and external users using the
corporate public services in an anomalous way. (6 points).
- Test of the SIEM rules and identification of the devices with anomalous behaviors (6 points).
- Written report; structure and content (4 pointsCommand and controll)
